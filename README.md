# Stablecoin Flow Analysis on Blockchains

Undergraduate Final Year Project  
Department of Computer Engineering  
Boğaziçi University  

**Student:** Celil Özkan 
**Supervisor:** Prof. Can Özturan  

## Overview

This project aims to analyze stablecoin transaction flows across multiple blockchain networks.

We will construct a dataset of selected stablecoin contracts and extract token transfer data from EVM-compatible chains. Using this data, we plan to build graph-based models to study transaction flows, address interactions, and cross-network movement patterns.

The project combines:

- Blockchain data retrieval
- Graph-based analysis
- Address classification
- Basic visualization and reporting

## Initial Scope

Planned networks include:

- Ethereum
- Polygon
- Arbitrum
- Avalanche

Planned stablecoins include:

- USDT
- USDC
- DAI
- XAUT

Scope may evolve as the project progresses.

## Project Phases

The work is organized into three main stages:

1. Fetch – Collect and store stablecoin transfer data  
2. Analysis – Build graph models and compute metrics  
3. Report – Interpret findings and present results  

## Development Guidelines

### Branching Convention

- `main` – Stable project state
- `feat/<issue-id>-<short-description>` – New functionality
- `fix/<issue-id>-<short-description>` – Bug fixes
- `refactor/<issue-id>-<short-description>` – Code improvements

All major work should be developed in a separate branch and merged into `main` after validation.

## Status

Project initiated.  
Currently defining architecture and data extraction approach.
